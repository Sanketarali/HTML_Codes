        The Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) is the most powerful method for Error-Detection and Correction. It is given as a kbit message and the transmitter creates an (n â€“ k) bit sequence called frame check sequence. The out coming frame, including n bits, is precisely divisible by some fixed number. Modulo 2 Arithmetic is used in this binary addition with no carries, just like the XOR operation.
